# POLYCAT
POLYCAT PIPELINE REPO

!! Always pull from master into development to make sure that you are working off of the master / production tree !!

This repo is separated by software
All scripts specifically relating to each software should be in their respective folders
Standalone polycat software should be packaged in its own unique folder under its name. 
Code that can span across multiple applications / acts on the os, should be placed into a folder in the pipeline_utiliteis folder.
